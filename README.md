# Ygoprodeck_csv_extractor
Small jupyter script to download card list from Ygoprodeck API (https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/) and write it into a TSV file.

Here, the goal was to get only the cards legal in Common Charity format, but you can edit it to make what you want to do.

In order to run the code, you should  install python (at least 3.7), and jupyter version (via jupyter notebook or VS code).

Then, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and you're ready to run the script.
